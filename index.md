## Frequency Asked Questions

### What is Klond?

Klond is a letter game, inspired by the card game [Klondike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(card_game)). The aim of the game is to create as many words as possible from the letters in the deck, with the fewest cards remaining.

### How do I play?

Double-click or drag the cards onto the shelf above the playing area. Press "Submit" to submit your word. Longer words are worth more points.

### Why do have cards left when there's no words to play?

There is no guarantee that the deck can be completely emptied. The aim is to score as many points as possible, not to clear the deck, although you will lose points if there are cards remaining at the end.

### Can I undo my last word?

No. That's cheating.

### Do you track me whilst I play?

No. I've got better things to do with my time.

### How do you make money from Klond?

I don't. I made it for love.

### Can I translate Klond to my own language?

Please do. [The code is on github](https://github.com/craignicol/klond). Please submit a pull request, or join a discussion.

### I've found a bug!

Please [file an issue on github](https://github.com/craignicol/klond/issues). I make no guarantee I will fix it though (see above about the amount of money I make from this).
